# VLG-Summer-2023

Hola!

In this exercise , i have made a Image to prompt translation using the VGG16 model. 

VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep.This is used to extract the features from the images.

This is used to extract the features from the images and then make use of these features to get the required prompt.

We have used the flickr8k dataset from the kaggle for the training purposes.

We have also used the BLUE metric for the evaluation for the prompt generated.
BLEU, or the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is a score for comparing a candidate translation of text to one or more reference translations. 
Although developed for translation, it can be used to evaluate text generated for a suite of natural language processing tasks.

Finally , i have used my own portrait to see how my model works 

My model recognized me as a snowboarder ..lol :p
